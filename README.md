# Slack TUI

A terminal user interface for Slack, built with go and the bubble tea framework.

## How to install and use it!

For now, just grab the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/espcaa/slack-tui/releases)
and simply run it in your terminal.

```bash
./slack-tui
```

## How to get your magic string??

For now the extension isn't published to the mozilla add-ons store (should be verified soon) so head over to the [extension repo](https://github.com/espcaa/slacktui-extension) and follow tthe instructions there!
