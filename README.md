# Slack TUI

A terminal user interface for Slack, built with go and the bubble tea framework.

## How to install and use it!

Use the go package manager to install the package:

```bash
go install github.com/espcaa/slacktui-extension@latest
```

Then, you can run the extension with:

```bash

```

_Note: you need to have the GOPATH in your path for this to work. If you don't know how to do that, check out the [go documentation](https://go.dev/wiki/GOPATH)._

## How to get your magic string??

Just get the *firefox* extension on the [extension page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/slacktui-wizzard/)! Then follow tthe instructions there!

## Simple keybinds & tips
